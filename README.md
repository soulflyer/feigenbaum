# Feigenbaum experiments

After the work of Mitchell Feigenbaum. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigenbaum_function

## Setup

requires the Modal_Object_Library written by Vincent Joseph Manzo which is included here in the lib directory. Check out the licence agreement therin if you want to make use of it. Install this library in a copy of vanilla pd and you should be good to go. Open the file feigenbaum-experiment.pd

Note that this generates midi notes, not sounds, so you will also need to connect it up to a midiplayer of some kind.
